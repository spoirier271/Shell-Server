# File:         Makefile
# Author:       Kerry Veenstra
#
# Purpose:      This is the base Makefile for CMPE 156 Assignments.
#
#               You can edit this Makefile as necessary.
#               This Makefile expects the following directory structure:
#
#                   ./Makefile          This file.
#                   ./src/              Put your project's source files here.
#                   ./doc/              Put your project's documentation here.
#                   ./obj/              Object files are created here.
#                   ./obj/Makefile      Don't edit this helper Makefile.
#                   ./bin/              Executables are created here.
#                   ./bin/Makefile      Don't edit this helper Makefile.
#
#               The bin and obj directories contain their own Makefiles.
#               Usually these Makefiles do not need to be changed.
#
#               The executable programs are written in the bin directory.
